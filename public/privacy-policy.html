    <h1>Privacy Policy for Strength Journeys</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: 6 March 2024</p>
    <p>
      Welcome to Strength Journeys, a free open-source web application designed
      to provide analysis and visualization of your barbell lifting history.
      This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your data in relation to your
      use of our app, particularly concerning the Google Sheets integration via
      the <code>drive.file</code> scope.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Processing and Storage:</h2>
    <p>
      Strength Journeys operates entirely within your web browser, with no user
      data stored on any servers. All processing and data storage occur locally
      on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Google Sheets Integration:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Scope:</strong> Our app uses the <code>drive.file</code> scope
        to access Google Sheets. This permission allows Strength Journeys to
        read Google Sheets files in your Google Drive that you explicitly open
        via Strength Journeys.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Data Access:</strong> During each login Strength Journeys will
        read your selected Google Sheet for the purpose of analyzing and
        visualizing your barbell lifting history. No additional files or folders
        are accessed. At any time you can choose 'forget Google Sheet' the app
        will not access again as the metadata (Google Drive SSID identifier)
        will be deleted from your browser.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Data Usage:</strong> The data from your Google Sheet is used
        solely within your browser memory for the duration of the session to
        show lifting visualization charts and other fitness statistical
        analytics. The data is neither transmitted to nor stored on any external
        servers, including ours.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Google API Services User Data Policy Compliance:</strong>
        Strength Journeys use and transfer to any other app of information
        received from Google APIs will adhere to
        <a
          href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy"
          >Google API Services User Data Policy</a
        >, including the Limited Use requirements.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>User Consent:</h2>
    <p>
      By using Strength Journeys, you consent to the data practices described in
      this Privacy Policy. You also acknowledge and consent to the limited use
      of your Google Sheets data as specified.
    </p>

    <h2>AI Lifting Assistant Page:</h2>
    <p>
      The user can opt-in to have certain lifting metadata and personal bio data
      sent to an AI chat API. No user data remains stored on our server. This
      feature is turned off by default. For more information go to:
      <a href="/ai-lifting-assistant">AI Lifting Assistant</a>. The other
      feature pages do not use AI.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy:</h2>
    <p>
      We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of
      any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are
      advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
